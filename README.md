# Demystifying OpenBSD 7.7 Router/Firewalls with Verizon FiOS Dual Stack (IPv4 + IPv6)

![Example Image](openbsdmountain2.jpg)

## Overview

This guide describes a **proven method** to configure an OpenBSD 7.7-based router/firewall with **dual stack IPv4 and IPv6** using residential **Verizon FiOS**. It includes support for dynamic IPv6 prefix delegation, DNS advertisement to LAN clients, DNSSEC, root server querying, or DNS over TLS using `unbound` to forward to Google, and optionally, DNS blocklisting utilizing RPZ.

Additionally, it attempts to explain how all the relevant components work together, under the hood, to provide functionality.

## Why?

- Because IPv6 is new and mysterious to me, and in my pursuit of understanding it, I wanted to share something with the community that may be helpful.
- Because simplicity is beautiful; OpenBSD is beautiful. It excels as a firewall/router platform, offering correctness, security, elegance and transparency. It resists the trend to incorporate bloatware disguised as features, inefficiency disguised as modernity, and unnecessary complexity. 

This guide shares a working configuration to help others build a reliable OpenBSD-based network gateway using the default tools found in the `base` system.

After reading, you should have a working understanding of what your OpenBSD firewall/router is doing and how it does so.

## üîß OpenBSD `base` Tools Used

- OpenBSD 7.7
- `pf` (OpenBSD's Packet Filter)
- `dhcpd` (IPv4 DHCP server daemon)
- `dhcpleased` - (OpenBSD's IPv4 DHCP client daemon replacing the older ISC dhclient)
- `dhcp6leased` (OpenBSD's IPv6 prefix delegation client)
- `rad` (OpenBSD's Router Advertisement Daemon)
- `slaacd` (StateLess Address Automatic Configuration daemon)
- `unbound` (Validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver)
- `rpz` (Response Policy Zones- DNS filtering feature in `unbound` )

## Hardware requirements:

Your choice of hardware will be dictated by your own network requirements, but, generally, a machine with at least 2 NICs (one for WAN, one for LAN) that is of a supported architecture will work.
Intel NICs are particularly well supported.

# In this guide, ix1 is WAN, ix0 is LAN

## üì¶ Installation Steps

## 1. Install OpenBSD 7.7
Official instructions at: https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html

During the install set up a WAN interface configured with automatic IPv4/IPv6 and a LAN interface with static IPv4 for now.

## 2. Check for *running* and *enabled* daemons 

```sh
rcctl ls started
rcctl ls on
```

*Disable the following daemons until we have a proper firewall.*

`slaacd` is automatically started on interfaces marked with `inet6 autoconf` in `/etc/hostname.if`, so it should be enabled and running on `ix1` after a fresh install if you chose IPv6 autoconf. 

Disable for now:
```sh
rcctl stop slaacd
rcctl disable slaacd
```

`dhcp6leased` is automatically started on interfaces marked with `inet6 autoconf` in `/etc/hostname.if`, so it should be enabled and running on `ix1` after a fresh install if you chose IPv6 autoconf. 

Disable for now:
```sh
rcctl stop dhcp6leased 
rcctl disable dhcp6leased 
```

`dhcpleased` is automatically started on interfaces marked with `inet autoconf` in `/etc/hostname.if`, so it should be enabled and running on `ix1` after a fresh install if you chose IPv4 autoconf. 

Disable for now:
```sh
rcctl stop dhcpleased 
rcctl disable dhcpleased 
```

## 3. Disable `resolvd` (recommended for a router)  (IPv4/IPv6)
I would recommend having full control over DNS (to avoid ISP DNS being assigned to router via DHCP):

```sh
rcctl stop resolvd
rcctl disable resolvd
```
## 4. Edit configuration files
### `/etc/sysctl.conf`  (IPv4/IPv6)
Turning the system into a router that will forward IPv4/IPv6 packets between network interfaces is simple and easy:

```sh
sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1

sysctl net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1
```
Ensure persistence across reboots:
```conf
# /etc/sysctl.conf for router/firewall
net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1
```

### `/etc/dhcpd.conf`  (IPv4)
Setting up an IPv4 DHCP server is also straightforward.

A simple, sane, working example:
```conf

# /etc/dhcpd.conf
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	option routers 192.168.1.1;
	option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;
	range 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.254;
}
```
### `/etc/resolv.conf`  (IPv4/IPv6)
This file configures the *router's* resolving behavior.
```conf
# /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 127.0.0.1
nameserver ::1
lookup file bind
search home.arpa  # <--- replace with your local domain name
```
`nameserver 127.0.0.1`‚Üí Use the local DNS server running on IPv4 loopback (localhost). This means the system will try to send DNS queries to itself at 127.0.0.1.

`nameserver ::1`‚Üí Same as above, but for IPv6 loopback. This allows DNS queries to be sent to localhost using IPv6.

`lookup file bind`‚Üí This controls the order of name resolution:

`file`‚Üí means check /etc/hosts first.

`bind`‚Üí Originally meant the **Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND)** software, which is the original and widely used DNS resolver and server suite developed at Berkeley in the early days of the Internet. It‚Äôs a legacy term that stuck. Now, it simply means *ask the DNS servers listed above (127.0.0.1 and ::1) if the name wasn‚Äôt found in /etc/hosts*.

`search home.arpa`‚Üí If you type just a short hostname (like, myserver), the system will try appending .home.arpa to it, making it myserver.home.arpa. This helps with resolving names in your home network automatically *from the router itself*.


### Create `/etc/dhcpleased.conf`  (IPv4)

dhcpleased does the following:
- Runs on interface(s) configured with `inet autoconf` (`ix1` in our example)
- Sends DHCP Discover/Request messages to find and lease an IPv4 address.
- Receives offers from a DHCP server, selects one, and requests it.
- Writes lease info to /var/db/dhcpleased/ so it persists across reboots.
- Configures your interface with:
  - IPv4 address
  - Default gateway (route add default)
  - DNS resolvers (written to /etc/resolv.conf)
  - Renews leases as needed to keep the IP assignment active.

The following simple example will ignore ISP DNS assignment (recommended). Also, be sure to disable `resolvd`, (recommended above). This gives us full control over our DNS:
```conf
# /etc/dhcpleased.conf
interface ix1 { ignore dns }
```

### `/etc/dhcp6leased.conf`:  (IPv6)

`dhcp6leased` is based on `dhcpleased` and serves a similar purpose and function, but for IPv6. It runs on interface(s) configured with `inet6 autoconf`.

This simple file is all that is needed:
```conf
# /etc/dhcp6leased.conf
request prefix delegation on ix1 for { ix0/64 }
```
**(WAN interface: ix1, LAN interface: ix0)**
## Explaining this simple file with IPv6 Math
- IPv6 addresses are 128 bit.
- Verizon gives out /56 prefixes; The first 56 bits are *fixed* by Verizon.
- A *prefix* defines an IPv6 *subnet*.
- Each /64 subnet: The first 64 bits define the subnet. And, since the first 56 are fixed,
- Bits 56 to 64 = 64 - 56 = 8 bits, so,
- 8 bits are available for our own subnetting.
- With 8 bits, we can have 2^8 = 256 different values (0 through 255). This gives us 256 possible /64 subnets for our network.
- **A /64 prefix defines an IPv6 subnet** that contains 18 Quintillion addresses; Every address in those subnets is a GUA (Global Unicast Address)- Quite generous. 
- The remaining 64 bits are client **SLAAC** territory.
  
## *The `/etc/dhcp6leased.conf` syntax does exactly what it implies: Request prefix delegation on WAN `ix1` and assign the first /64 to LAN `ix0`*

## Breakdown: ##

56 bits: Fixed by Verizon (2006:4040:1234:56)

8 bits: Yours for subnetting (00, 01, 02... ff)

64 bits: Host addresses within each subnet (SLAAC territory)

Math check:
56 + 8 + 64 = 128 bits

What this gives you:
- 256 possible subnets (from your 8 bits: 2^8 = 256)
- Each subnet can have ~18 quintillion hosts (from the 64 host bits: 2^64)

Example subnet:

2006:4040:1234:5601::/64

2006:4040:1234:56 = Verizon's 56 bits

01 = Your subnet choice (1 of 256 possible)

:: = 64 zero bits available for host addresses

2006:4040:1234:5601::1 (assigned by `dhcp6leased` on OpenBSD router `ix0` (LAN))

On the 2006:4040:1234:5601::/64 subnet, device SLAAC clients can assign:

2006:4040:1234:5601::a1b2:c3ff:fed4:5678 (assigned by device 1 SLAAC client)

2006:4040:1234:5601::dead:beef:cafe:1234 (assigned by device 2 SLAAC client)

...etc.

So yes - we get 256 massive subnets, each capable of holding far more devices than exist on Earth.
# Every address in those subnets is a GUA (Global Unicast Address).
> 
> **Why they're all GUAs:**
> * **Global routing prefix**: `2006:4040::/32` is allocated to Verizon by IANA
> * **Globally routable**: Any address starting with `2006:4040:` can be reached from anywhere on the IPv6 internet
> * **Unique worldwide**: No other network uses your specific `/56` prefix
> 
> **So all of these are GUAs:**
> * `2006:4040:1234:5600::1` (router LAN interface on subnet 0)
> * `2006:4040:1234:5601::dead:beef` (device on subnet 1)
> * `2006:4040:1234:56ff::a1b2:c3d4` (device on subnet 255)
> 
> **What makes them "global":**
> * They're not private/local addresses (like `fc00::/7` or `fe80::/10`)
> * They're not multicast (`ff00::/8`) or reserved ranges
> * They're part of the global IPv6 routing table
> 
> **The beauty of IPv6:** Unlike IPv4 where you typically get one public IP and NAT everything else, with IPv6 every device gets its own globally routable address. Your laptop, phone, IoT devices - they all get real internet addresses that can be reached directly (subject to firewall rules).
> 
> We have 256 subnets, each with ~18 quintillion globally unique, internet-routable addresses.

### `/etc/hostname.ix0` (LAN):  (IPv4/IPv6)

### Create a ULA (Unique Local Address)- IPv6's equivalent to RFC 1918 private addresses like 192.168.x.x in IPv4.
Why it's useful:

* **ULA**s provide stable, predictable addresses for local network communication.
* Unlike **GUA**s (which can change when your ISP changes your delegated prefix), **ULA**s remain constant.
* Ensures local services and device-to-device communication continues working even if your ISP prefix changes-Provides a fallback for local network services.

You *could* easily create your own random ULA/prefix using `jot`:
```sh
jot -r 6 0 255 | xargs printf "fd00:%02x%02x:%02x%02x:%02x%02x::1/64\n"
```
The output should be something like:
```sh
fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1/64
```
But, ULAs are private and not routable on the internet, so feel free to arbitrarily create your own ULA which is more readable;
```fd00:feed:dead::1/64``` is perfectly fine as well.

So, now we have:
- A ULA: fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1 = ULA (the individual address)
- A subnet/prefix: fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::/64 = ULA prefix (the subnet)

Terminology clarification:

When we write out fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1/64, we are specifying:
- The *individual ULA address*: fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1 with subnet information: /64
- The *prefix* is: fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::/64

We will use the ULA as an alias for the LAN interface in `hostname.ix0` and `rad.conf` to advertise to our LAN clients. The prefix will be used in `unbound.conf`, to allow incoming DNS requests.  In this way, we have a permanent address on our LAN interface as well as a /64 subnet for private use that will not change, unlike the dynamic prefix and the Global Unicast Address (GUA) from the ISP assigned to the LAN. *More on this later.*

```sh
# /etc/hostname.ix0 (LAN):
inet 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.255
inet6
inet6 alias fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1/64  # ULA alias for LAN interface (Create your own.)
```
- `inet 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.255`:  Assigns a static IPv4 address to the interface, using a standard /24 subnet. Devices on the LAN will use this as their IPv4 gateway.

- `inet6`:  Enables IPv6 processing on the LAN interface. With this flag, the kernel will create a link-local address for our interface, and allow `dhcp6leased` to assign a Global Unicast Address (GUA) later. Recall our `dhcp6leased.conf`; `request prefix delegation on ix1 for { ix0/64 }`

- `inet6 alias fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1/64`:  Assigns a stable Unique Local Address (ULA) to the LAN interface. For use with internal-only services (like DNS via `unbound`), providing consistent local IPv6 reachability even if the delegated GUA prefix changes or is unavailable.

This simple setup ensures:
- Dual-stack (IPv4 + IPv6) support on the LAN  
- A fixed local IPv6 address for internal services (via ULA)
  
### `/etc/hostname.ix1` (WAN) should *probably* be configured during install:  (IPv4/IPv6)
Simple, clean and brainless. And, it *just works*:
```sh
# /etc/hostname.ix1 (WAN)
inet autoconf
inet6 autoconf
```

- `inet autoconf`: Enables DHCPv4 on the WAN interface. The system will automatically obtain a public IPv4 address, subnet mask, and default gateway from the ISP via `dhcpleased`.
- `inet6 autoconf`: Enables IPv6 autoconfiguration on the WAN interface. This brings up the interface with a link-local IPv6 address, installs a default route via `slaacd`, and simultaneous communication with the ISP‚Äôs DHCPv6 server for prefix delegation via `dhcp6leased`.

With `hostname.ix1`, `hostname.ix0`, and `dhcp6leased.conf` complete, `dhcp6leased` is now configured to receive the delegated prefix on the WAN, write it to `/var/db/dhcp6leased/ix1` and install a GUA within its subnet ending in ::1 to the LAN interface. `slaacd` is now configured to process ISP router advertisements and install the default route.
  
### üî• `/etc/pf.conf` (Firewall Rules)  (IPv4/IPv6)

A clean and concise dual stack PF configuration with minimal logging, which works with both IPv4 and IPv6. It is based on a "block all in, let anything out" foundation, with security against spoofing, and selected filtering for functionality; this verbatim configuration is generally fine for a trusted home LAN, but again, KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

## *IPv6 essential considerations:*
- There must be a route-to or pass out rule in `pf.conf` for IPv6 outbound from LAN to WAN. This is easy to forget and will silently block IPv6. This is covered, because our example let's everything out- `pass out quick inet6 keep state`.
- ICMPv6 needs to be allowed on WAN and LAN or many things break- neighbor discovery, path MTU discovery, RA, etc. This is covered by `pass in quick inet6 proto ipv6-icmp from any to any icmp6-type {
    echoreq, echorep, unreach, toobig, timex, paramprob,
    neighbrsol, neighbradv, routersol, routeradv
} keep state`
- `dhcp6leased` <-> server traffic (udp port 546 <- 547) must be enabled on WAN ix1. Our example covers this with `pass in quick on egress inet6 proto udp from any port 547 to any port 546`.

```
### Reload `pf` rules:  (IPv4/IPv6)

```sh
pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf
```

## 5. Start `dhcpleased` (IPv4)
Now that we have a proper firewall in place, we can start connections.

Start `dhcpleased` with:
```sh
rcctl enable dhcpleased
rcctl start dhcpleased
```
At this point, you may wish to go back and re-check your resolv.conf, to ensure it has not been overwritten.
### Check WAN for public IPv4 address:
```sh
ifconfig ix1
```
You should see a valid IPv4 address.

## 6. Start `slaacd`:  (IPv6)

`slaacd` will process RAs from the ISP to establish a default route on the WAN interface (`ix1`)

```sh
rcctl enable slaacd
rcctl start slaacd
```

## 7. Acquire Delegated Prefix (IPv6)

### Enable and run `dhcp6leased` to initiate prefix delegation

Open another terminal and do:
```sh
tcpdump -ni ix1 udp and port 546 or port 547 and ip6
```
Go back to the original terminal and do:
```sh
rcctl enable dhcp6leased
rcctl start dhcp6leased
```
Recall from above that we configured `/etc/hostname.ix1` with `inet6 autoconf`. Therefore, `dhcp6leased` is called on `ix1`.

Return to the `tcpdump` terminal.

You should see something like:

```
...prefix delegation #1 2600:4040:AAAA:BBBB::/56 received on ix1 from server ...
```

Having negotiated the lease, `dhcp6leased` writes the prefix to `/var/db/dhcp6leased/ix1` for persistence.

## 8. üì° Create `/etc/rad.conf` (Router Advertisement)  (IPv6)

```conf
# /etc/rad.conf
interface ix0 {
    dns {
        nameserver fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1  # Your custom ULA alias from hostname.ix0
    }
}
```
*Substitute with your actual ULA.*

By default, `rad` discovers prefixes to announce by inspecting the IPv6 addresses configured on an interface (rad.conf(5)); At this point, the delegated prefix, and the prefix (subnet) encompassing our ULA.

`dns.. nameserver fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1..` configures `rad` to advertise the DNS nameserver (ULA) to your LAN. 

This means:
- Clients will receive both the delegated prefix (2600:4040....::/64) and the ULA's prefix (fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::/64) even though not explicitly included in `rad.conf`
- Clients also receive the custom DNS (ULA) address (fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1) configured above.
- They will autoconfigure GUA addresses like 2600:4040:AAAA:BBBB::abcd for themselves derived from the delegated prefix using SLAAC.
- These GUAs give each device on your network a publicly routable IPv6 address.
- They will autoconfigure private ULA addresses like fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::abcd for themselves derived from the ULA's prefix using SLAAC.
- *They then use those private ULA source addresses to query DNS* at your router‚Äôs ULA (fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1).

## *Why use a ULA for DNS? Why not use our GUA derived from Verizon's delegated prefix? After all, it's our LAN IP address.*

By creating a ULA alias for our LAN ix0, and a corresponding prefix, we've essentially created a *private* ULA subnet (fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::/64) on the LAN for the specific purpose of stable internal DNS service, and we will configure `unbound` to listen on the ULA address fd00:AAA:BBBB:CCCC::1 and allow traffic in from its subnet. Advertising our GUA as our DNS is not best practice, because GUAs are publicly routable addresses. Yes, `pf` will block the advertisement from leaving, but using a private subnet is advantageous.

This concept was strange to me at first, since, coming from the frugality of IPv4, it seemed excessive to create 18 quintillion addresses simply for my little network's DNS. 

But, IPv6 actually encourages this for:
- Stability: Your ULA doesn‚Äôt change like your Verizon-assigned GUA. This makes it a perfect anchor for DNS, which needs consistency.
- Privacy: ULAs aren't routable on the public Internet, so there's no exposure.
- Simplicity: You avoid having to dynamically reconfigure Unbound or whenever your GUA changes.
- Reachability: Clients can always find Unbound at fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1, even if your global prefix changes.

## 9. Enable and start `rad`  (IPv6)
Enable and start rad, so that it advertises both the delegated prefix and DNS info on LAN.  

You can verify that both the delegated prefix, ULA prefix and ULA are advertised using `tcpdump`:

Open another terminal and do:
```sh
tcpdump -i ix0 -s 256 -vvv -n icmp6 and 'ip6[40] == 134'
```
Switch to your original terminal and do:
```sh
rcctl enable rad
rcctl start rad
```
Then switch back to watch the output from `tcpdump`. You should see your delegated prefix, ULA prefix, as well as the ULA being advertised.

*I struggled understanding this for weeks until dave14305 was kind enough to share his insight on this. The `-s 256` was the key. Without it, output was truncated (it would contain either the ULA or GUA, but never both) and confused me for a long time. Thank you, dave!*

## 10. Enable and start `dhcpd` to serve IPv4 addresses on the LAN: (IPv4)
```sh
rcctl enable dhcpd
rcctl set dhcpd flags ix0
rcctl start dhcpd
```
## 11. Reboot and verify.
Rebooting is not strictly necessary at this point, but it will prove our configurations survive a system restart.

```sh
reboot
```

Verify LAN address assignments:  (IPv4/IPv6)

```sh
ifconfig ix0
```

In addition to your static IPv4 LAN address, you should see your IPv6 Global Unicast Address (GUA):

```
...
inet 192.168.1.1
...
inet6 2600:4040:AAAA:BBBB::1 prefixlen 64
```

*You are getting close to the summit!*

## The IPv6 Prefix Delegation model (This ain't IPv4!):

Verizon FiOS assigns a **delegated IPv6 prefix** (typically a /56) to your router via DHCPv6 rather than assigning a Global Unicast Address (GUA) directly to the router‚Äôs WAN interface. This aligns with IPv6‚Äôs design principles, which support end-to-end connectivity without the need for NAT.

## How It Works on OpenBSD 7.7

**`slaacd`** runs on the OpenBSD router's WAN interface, processing the RA from the ISP, and installs a default route.

**`dhcp6leased`** handles all *DHCPv6* communication with Verizon on the WAN interface. It sends a request for prefix delegation (IA_PD) and receives a delegated prefix, usually a /56. It then subdivides that prefix according to its configuration and **records subprefixes assigned to each LAN interface** in its internal lease database located at `/var/db/dhcp6leased/`. In our example `hostname.ix1`, `dhcp6leased` is directed to assign the prefix to `ix0`.

**`rad`** (Router Advertisement Daemon) obtains its prefix information via `getifaddrs()` or the routing socket. It uses this interface information to construct the router advertisement messages and sends Router Advertisements (RAs) on the LAN interface(s), to advertise the corresponding prefix (subnet) (and DNS, if configured as such). This allows clients to self-configure IPv6 addresses using SLAAC.

### Why This Design Works

**No WAN GUA Needed**  
Unlike IPv4, where a public WAN address is necessary for NAT, IPv6 routers simply route packets using their delegated prefix. There‚Äôs no need for a GUA on the WAN interface in this setup.

**Link-Local Sufficient**  
Simply bringing an interface up with the `inet6` or `inet6 autoconf` flags will give the interface a link-local address. The router's WAN interface uses this link-local IPv6 address (`fe80::/10`) to communicate with Verizon‚Äôs ONT, which is sufficient for routing. 

**Delegated GUA on LAN**  
The router receives its own IPv6 address on each LAN interface via `dhcp6leased`. These addresses are derived from the delegated prefix. The LAN interface prefixes are then advertised throughout their internal networks via `rad`, so that client devices may configure their own GUAs, using SLAAC.

**Efficient and Compliant**  
This design reflects IPv6 best practices and conserves address space while enabling native, end-to-end IPv6 routing for all LAN clients- without NAT.

## 12. DNS and `unbound`  (IPv4/IPv6)

Unbound is a recursive, caching DNS resolver with DNSSEC validation, DNS over TLS, and RPZ support. The following example allows for using the root servers or forwarding DNS over TLS to Google, as well as blocking malicious domains, depending on how you wish to proceed.

### `/var/unbound/etc/unbound.conf`

```conf
# /var/unbound/etc/unbound.conf

Notice the `interface: ix0` clause.

This directs `unbound` to **listen** on all addresses assigned to the LAN interface. 

In our example, this now includes:
- 192.168.1.1
- Our **ULA** fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1
- Our **GUA** 2600:4040:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1

However, notice the `access-control:` section:
```conf
access-control: 192.168.1.0/24 allow
access-control: fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::/64
```
Only the RFC 1918 subnet 192.168.1.0/24 and our RFC 4193 ULA subnet fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::/64 are granted access.
So, essentially, unbound listens on the interface, and the `access-control:` limits which addresses are granted access. Therefore, the `interface: ix0` is being used as shorthand. We could also explicitly configure by addresses using `interface:` if we so choose.

Enable and start `unbound`
```sh
rcctl enable unbound
rcctl start unbound
```

## 13. Reboot and test
Ensure `dhcpleased`, `dhcpd`, `dhcp6leased`, `rad`, `slaacd` and `unbound` are enabled and running:
```sh
rcctl ls on
rcctl ls started
```
```sh
reboot
```
Test your configuration from the router using the tools of your choice, e.g.:
```sh
ifconfig ix0
ping6 example.com
dig -6 @fd00:AAAA:BBBB:CCCC::1 example.com AAAA
dig example.com AAAA
```
https://test-ipv6.com/ can be utilized from clients.

# Deeper Dive: The Three Main IPv6 Daemons in OpenBSD 7.7

OpenBSD 7.7‚Äôs IPv6 stack uses three distinct but complementary daemons for address acquisition, prefix delegation, and router advertisement. Together, these handle both upstream (WAN) and downstream (LAN) IPv6 configuration without requiring third-party tools. Each has a clear purpose, and understanding their separation makes troubleshooting and configuration much easier.

## 1. `slaacd` - SLAAC and RA listener for upstream
`slaacd` (Stateless Address Automatic Configuration Daemon) listens for IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) from the upstream ISP router (e.g., Verizon FiOS gateway) on the WAN interface.
Its core responsibilities:

### Address assignment via SLAAC:
If the RA contains a prefix with the ‚Äúautonomous address-configuration‚Äù (A) flag set, `slaacd` will automatically assign a global unicast address (GUA) on that interface. (N/A in our case)

### Default route installation:
If the RA‚Äôs router lifetime is non-zero, `slaacd` installs an IPv6 default route via the RA source.

**`slaacd` only processes RAs on interfaces configured for `inet6 autoconf` in `hostname.if`. It does not serve LAN clients - its scope is inbound RAs from upstream.**

## 2. `dhcp6leased` - DHCPv6 client and PD handler
`dhcp6leased` is OpenBSD‚Äôs built-in DHCPv6 client daemon, introduced in 7.3 and now the standard for 7.7.

Its core responsibilities:

### Prefix Delegation (PD):
Requests and maintains an IPv6 prefix (often /56 or /60) from the ISP‚Äôs DHCPv6 server. This is typically used for downstream LAN addressing.

### Address assignment :
Verizon FiOS typically assigns only a delegated prefix (IA_PD) via DHCPv6 to the CPE (router). If configured, `dhcp6leased` then assigns IPv6 addresses (GUAs) on its LAN interface(s) using that delegated prefix. (Recall the `inet6` flag in our `hostname.ix0` which allows for IPv6 on LAN, and our `dhcp6leased.conf` which directs `dhcp6leased` to assign the delegated prefix to our LAN- `ix0`.). 

### Lease persistence:
State is stored under `/var/db/dhcp6leased/<ifname>` so leases survive daemon restarts and reboots.

**On many Verizon FiOS connections, the WAN interface will have only a link-local address and no GUA, even though PD works. This is expected.**

## 3. rad ‚Äî Router Advertisement Daemon for downstream
`rad` advertises IPv6 configuration to LAN clients by sending periodic and solicited RAs on LAN interfaces.

Its core responsibilities:

### Prefix advertisement:
Automatically discovers prefixes to announce by inspecting the IPv6 addresses configured on an interface, including:
- The IPv6 prefix derived from the ISP‚Äôs delegated prefix so LAN clients can configure their own GUAs via SLAAC.
- Any other addresses assign to the interface (the ULA prefix we assigned in `hostname.ix0` in our case)
### Router lifetime advertisement:
Informs LAN clients of the router‚Äôs availability as the default gateway.

### RDNSS and DNSSL options:
Can optionally advertise DNS servers (as in our case) to LAN clients, allowing for SLAAC-only networks without the need for DHCPv6.

### Dynamic reconfiguration:
If the delegated prefix changes (e.g., after a DHCPv6 renewal), `rad` can be reloaded to advertise the updated prefix without restarting the daemon.

## Key Point:
`rad` only sends outbound RAs to LAN clients. It does not listen for or process inbound RAs from upstream ‚Äî that‚Äôs `slaacd`‚Äôs job.

# What is happening here (summary):
| Step | Daemon               | Role                                                                                                       |
| ---- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **`slaacd`**         | Runs on router WAN interface aongside `dhcp6leased`, processes ISP RAs, assigns default route  |
| 2    | **`dhcp6leased`**    | Sends DHCPv6 request to Verizon on WAN `ix1`, receives delegated prefix, writes lease info to `/var/db/dhcp6leased/ix1` and assigns GUA to LAN |
| 3    | **`rad`**            | Obtains prefix information via `getifaddrs()`, advertises all prefixes, gateway (and DNS) on LAN `ix0`   |
| 4    | **`unbound`**        | Serves DNS to LAN clients using ULA address, accepts queries on ULA subnet                                               |
| 5    | **`dhcpleased`**     | Handles IPv4 DHCP on WAN `ix1`, assigns IPv4 address and default route                                    |
| 6    | **`dhcpd`**          | The IPv4 dhcp server; hands out IPv4 local addresses on LAN |

That's it! Hopefully, this guide has been valuable to you. 

### Troubleshooting Table 
The following table may be useful, especially if you configured your system to be very close to the examples.
| Problem | Symptom | Check/Command | Possible Cause(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **No Internet (IPv4)** | No IPv4 address on `ix1` (`ifconfig ix1`).

| **No Internet (IPv6)** | No IPv6 GUA on `ix0` (`ifconfig ix0`). LAN clients have no IPv6 address. `ping6 ipv6.google.com` fails. | `rcctl ls on` <br> `rcctl ls started` <br> `dhcp6leased -d` <br> `ifconfig ix0` | <ul><li>`dhcp6leased`, `rad`, or `slaacd` is not running/enabled.</li><li>`dhcp6leased` did not get a prefix from Verizon.</li><li>`rad.conf` is misconfigured (no prefix or DNS).</li><li>`pf.conf` is blocking `ipv6-icmp` or DHCPv6 traffic (ports 546/547 UDP).</li><li>`rad` needs to be restarted after a new prefix is acquired.</li></ul> |
| **DNS Resolution Fails** | `dig example.com` fails from router. Clients cannot resolve names. | `rcctl ls on` <br> `rcctl ls started` <br> `unbound-checkconf` <br> `unbound-control status` <br> `cat /etc/resolv.conf` | <ul><li>`unbound` is not running/enabled.</li><li>`unbound.conf` has syntax errors.</li><li>`unbound.conf` `access-control` is **too restrictive**.</li><li>`resolv.conf` on router is not pointing to 127.0.0.1 and ::1.</li><li>Firewall is blocking port 53.</li></ul> |
| **Clients get IPv4 but not IPv6** | `ifconfig ix0` shows a GUA, but clients only get an IPv4 address. | `rcctl ls on` <br> `rcctl ls started` <br> `tcpdump -ni ix0 ip6` <br> `rcctl restart rad` <br>  | <ul><li>`rad` is not running or enabled.</li><li>Firewall is blocking IPv6 traffic.</li><li>`rad.conf` is missing or misconfigured.</li><li>`rad` may need to be restarted to pick up the new prefix.</li><li>Client OS/configuration issue.</li></ul> |

## **ENJOY!**

If you have not done so already, I recommend setting up `dhcpd.conf` and `unbound.conf` for local hostname resolution by using static reservations. An excellent guide which expands on this is here: https://openbsdrouterguide.net/

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Why OpenBSD?

Because it does the job simply, securely, and elegantly. It's ideal for a firewall/router role (I use it on my desktop and laptop as well). OpenBSD is simply the most beautiful modern OS.
I found it 20 years ago, (though I am still a novice) fell in love with it, and I have donated to the project. I hope this page contributes to the project by helping someone.

### Why not Linux or FreeBSD?

They're great tools, but I find them unnecessarily complex, especially for routing/firewalling. OpenBSD has fewer surprises and a consistent, coherent philosophy.

### Why do you include Google DNS?

- In my region, Google DNS is fast and reliable.
- Other providers and root servers did not perform well for me.
- Feel free to configure your system to your own preference.
  
## üôè Final Thoughts

This guide exists to help others get a solid OpenBSD dual stack router working with Verizon FiOS. I spent weeks testing, reading, and tweaking. If it helps one person, it was worth the effort. If you are that person, or, if you find value in this guide, I would be honored if you clicked on the star. Thanks for reading.
